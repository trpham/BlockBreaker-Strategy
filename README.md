#### BlockBreaker Game Strategy
*The code includes some strategies to build classic Block Breaker game.*

The game consists of **lines of blocks** on top of GUI platform, a **paddle** at the bottom, an a **ball**. Every time the ball touches the block, the block(s) is/are destroyed and the ball bounces back.  Power-up balls hided randomly behind some blocks, and when those block are destroyed, the power-up are released and falling down. New ball added when power-up ball hit the paddle. With arraylist of the block object, playwer wins the game when all the blocks are destroyed, and lose otherwise.
